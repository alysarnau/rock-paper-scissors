# rock-paper-scissors

This is a project made for the Foundations course (specifically the Javascript portion) of the Odin Project!

It is run through a basic UI, will keep a running tally of score, and will announce a winner once either the player or the computer gets to 5. There is a reset button. Enjoy!
